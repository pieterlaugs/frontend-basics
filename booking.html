<SCRIPT LANGUAGE = "JavaScript"> The language attribute is deprecated, use the type attribute instead:

<script type = "text/javascript">

var passengerName; // first string entered by user
var seatType; // second string entered by user
var classType;
// read first number from user as a string and assigns to var first
passengerName = window.prompt( "Enter your name:", "0" );

// read second number from user as a string and assigns to var
second
seatType = window.prompt( "For First Class type 1 or 2 for
Economy:", "0" ); 
In regards to this assignment, it seems that you should be placing
those in a form instead of doing a prompt. For example, what would
happen if a user wanted to get 2 or more seats? If I refresh the page,
all data is lost, unless you've learned how to use cookies.

if (seatType ==1){
classType = ("First Class"); }

Place matching closing brace here.
Else 
Syntax is case sensitive. That should be a lowercase 'e' instead.
classType=("Economy")};

document.writeln( "<H1>Boarding Pass Information</H1>" );
document.writeln( "<TABLE BORDER = \"1\"" + "WIDTH = \"40%\">");
document.writeln( "<TR><TD>" + "<b>" +"NAME:" + "</b>" +
"</TD></TR>" );
document.writeln( "<TR><TD>" + passengerName +
"</TD></TR>" );
document.writeln( "<TR><TD>" + "<b>" + "SEAT TYPE"+ "</b>" +
"</TD></TR>" );
document.writeln( "<TR><TD>" + seatType+
"</TD></TR>" );
document.writeln( "<TR><TD>" + "<b>" + "CLASS TYPE"+ "</b>" +
"</TD></TR>" );
document.writeln( "<TR><TD>" + classType +
"</TD></TR>" );
document.writeln( "</TABLE>" ); 
Instead of doing bunch of document.writeln, it would be easier to
create a form and then manipulate the values of the input therein.
